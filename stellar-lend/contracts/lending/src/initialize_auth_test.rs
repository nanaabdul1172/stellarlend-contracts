//! Tests for the `initialize` auth requirement (issue #1498).
//!
//! `LendingContract::initialize` must call `admin.require_auth()` so that an
//! attacker cannot front-run the deployer and claim the admin role by
//! submitting their own `initialize` transaction first.
//!
//! Test coverage:
//! - Happy path: the intended admin signs → `initialize` succeeds.
//! - Sad path: a different address signs → the call is rejected by the Soroban
//!   runtime (panics, which is the expected behaviour for auth failures in the
//!   Soroban test harness).
//! - Sad path: no auth mock at all → the call is rejected.
