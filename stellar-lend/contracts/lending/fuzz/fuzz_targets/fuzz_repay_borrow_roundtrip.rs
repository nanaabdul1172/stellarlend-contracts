//! Fuzz target: borrow -> repay round-trip through `debt.rs`
//!
//! Drives `borrow_amount` and `repay_amount` directly (no `Env`/storage
//! involved — both functions are pure transforms over `DebtPosition`)
//! with a randomized sequence of `(action, amount, elapsed)` steps and a
//! single fixed interest rate for the whole sequence, interleaving time
//! advances between actions.
//!
//! ## Invariants checked
//!
//! 1. **Non-negative principal** — `position.principal >= 0` holds after
//!    every successful `borrow_amount` / `repay_amount` call.
//! 2. **Full repay zeroes principal** — if the repaid amount is `>=` the
//!    effective debt owed at that instant (principal + accrued interest),
//!    the resulting principal is exactly `0`.
//! 3. **Exact partial repay** — otherwise the resulting principal equals
//!    `effective_debt - amount` exactly (a user can never be left owing
//!    more, or less, than the precise remainder).
//! 4. **Monotonic effective debt between repayments** — `effective_debt`
//!    never decreases across borrows / pure time advances; it may only
//!    drop immediately after a repayment, which resets the baseline.
//! 5. **No panics except the documented `DebtError::Overflow`** — any
//!    other error (notably `InvalidAmount` on a strictly positive
//!    amount) or an assertion failure is a bug.
//!
//! Amount and elapsed values are drawn from a bounded but bimodal
//! distribution: mostly small/realistic values to exercise deep,
//! long-running sequences, with an occasional extreme value to drive
//! `principal` toward `i128::MAX` and trigger the expected
//! `DebtError::Overflow` path (accumulated over several large borrows,
//! since a single i128::MAX/4-ish borrow alone does not overflow).
