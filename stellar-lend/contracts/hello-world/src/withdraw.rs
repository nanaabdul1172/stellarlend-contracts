//! withdraw.rs — Collateral withdrawal logic for the StellarLend hello-world contract.
//!
//! Implements [`withdraw_collateral`] and [`WithdrawError`], consistent with
//! the real withdrawal logic in the parallel `stellarlend-lending` crate's
//! `LendingContract::withdraw`.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Collateral is stored under [`crate::DataKey::Balance`] and debt under
//! [`crate::DataKey::Debt`] — the same keys used by the simple `deposit`,
//! `borrow`, and `repay` entrypoints in `lib.rs`.  The `asset` parameter
//! is accepted for API compatibility with the multi-asset cross-asset path
//! but is not used in storage lookups in this single-asset implementation.
//!
//! # Health-factor check
//!
//! After withdrawal the remaining collateral must satisfy the same invariant
//! used by `assert_borrow_solvent` in the lending crate:
//!
//! ```text
//! collateral_after × LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS ≥ HEALTH_FACTOR_SCALE × debt
//! ```
//!
//! Constants (mirrored from the lending crate):
//! - `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS = 8_000`  (80 % liquidation threshold)
//! - `HEALTH_FACTOR_SCALE       = 10_000`
//!
//! When the user has no outstanding debt the check is trivially satisfied.
//!
//! # Event
//!
//! A [`WithdrawEvent`] is emitted on every successful withdrawal, matching
//! the `WithdrawEvent` schema used by the lending crate's `emit_withdraw`.
