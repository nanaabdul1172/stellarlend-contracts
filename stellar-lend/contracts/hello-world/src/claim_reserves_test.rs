#![cfg(test)]

//! Tests for exact-accounting bounds on `HelloContract::claim_reserves`.
//!
//! Goal: prove that protocol reserve claims are bounded by the accrued
//! [`ReserveDataKey::ReserveBalance`] balance and that storage is debited
//! exactly by the claimed amount on a successful claim.
//!
//! These tests pin:
//! - **Over-claim guard**  — a claim with `amount > reserve_balance` is rejected
//!   with `RiskManagementError::InvalidParameter` and the reserve is unchanged.
//! - **Exact debit**       — on success, `new_balance == old_balance − amount`
//!   with no rounding, no off-by-one.
//! - **Admin gate**        — non-admin callers are rejected with
//!   `RiskManagementError::Unauthorized`; the reserve is unchanged.
//! - **View consistency**  — `get_reserve_balance(asset)` reflects the
//!   post-claim storage state for any caller.
//! - **Asset isolation**   — a claim against one asset's `ProtocolReserve`
//!   bucket never affects any other asset's bucket.
//! - **Boundary**          — `amount == reserve_balance` is allowed and zeros
//!   the bucket (the `>` vs `>=` boundary in the clamp).
