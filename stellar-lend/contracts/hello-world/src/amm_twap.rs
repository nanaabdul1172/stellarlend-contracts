/// amm_twap.rs — TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) accumulator for the StellarLend AMM.
///
/// # Design
///
/// We maintain a **cumulative price** per asset pair using the standard Uniswap v2 / constant-
/// product model, adapted for Soroban's ledger timestamp (seconds since Unix epoch).
///
/// For a pool holding `reserve_a` of asset A and `reserve_b` of asset B:
///
/// ```text
/// price_a_cumulative += (reserve_b / reserve_a) * Δt
/// price_b_cumulative += (reserve_a / reserve_b) * Δt
/// ```
///
/// where `Δt = current_timestamp − last_timestamp`.
///
/// To query the TWAP over a window `[T-window, T]` a caller snapshots the cumulative value at
/// two points and divides the difference by the elapsed time:
///
/// ```text
/// twap = (price_cumulative_now − price_cumulative_then) / window_seconds
/// ```
///
/// # Manipulation resistance
///
/// * The accumulator only moves forward in time — it cannot be rewound.
/// * Prices are only updated *after* the reserves have changed; a sandwich attack must hold the
///   position for at least one ledger close (≈ 5 s) to shift the TWAP.
/// * Callers should use a window of at least **30 ledgers** (≈ 150 s) for any security-critical
///   use such as liquidation valuation.  A 300-ledger window (≈ 25 min) is recommended for
///   large-value positions.
/// * A single-block flash-loan cannot meaningfully influence a 30+ ledger TWAP.
///
/// # Snapshot eviction policy
///
/// Snapshots are persisted every [`SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_SECS`] seconds. To bound storage rent and
/// per-read deserialisation cost, the ring buffer is capped at [`MAX_SNAPSHOTS`] entries.
///
/// When `maybe_write_snapshot` would exceed the cap it first checks that evicting the oldest
/// entry will not drop a snapshot that is still within the maximum supported TWAP window
/// ([`MAX_TWAP_WINDOW_SECS`]).  Because the ring is sized so that
/// `MAX_SNAPSHOTS × SNAPSHOT_INTERVAL_SECS ≥ MAX_TWAP_WINDOW_SECS × EVICTION_SAFETY_FACTOR`,
/// eviction only removes data that is older than the longest supported query window, ensuring
/// every valid `get_twap` call can still find a start snapshot.
///
/// See `docs/TWAP_SNAPSHOT_POLICY.md` for the storage rationale and
/// `docs/TWAP_READ_PERF.md` for the read-cost budget.
