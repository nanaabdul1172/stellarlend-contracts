/// - The primary oracle feed for `asset` was either absent or stale
///   (age > `max_staleness_seconds`).
/// - The resolved price for this call is derived from AMM pool reserves
///   over a [`TWAP_FALLBACK_WINDOW_SECS`]-second window.

/// # Versioning
///
/// This is a **versioned** event (`schema_version` field present).  Any
/// future breaking change must follow the bump-and-dual-emit procedure in
/// `docs/EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSIONING.md`.
