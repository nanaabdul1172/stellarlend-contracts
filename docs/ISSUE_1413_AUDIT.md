# Issue #1413 — audit + caveat (companion to the crate-level rustdoc note)

> **Note (bound):** this file documents the docs-only closure of
> [#1413](https://github.com/StellarLend/stellarlend-contracts/issues/1413).
> **Delete this file** when `flash_swap_a_for_b` and `repay_flash_swap`
> are actually implemented, so it cannot drift in lockstep with an
> unlanded API.

> **Note (location):** this file lives at `docs/ISSUE_1413_AUDIT.md`
> because it is durable project documentation, not part of any
> contract crate. It mirrors the convention used by
> [`docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md`](./INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md),
> [`docs/RESERVE_ACCOUNTING.md`](./RESERVE_ACCOUNTING.md), and the
> other notes under `docs/`.

This file documents the evidence behind the docs-only PR that closes
[#1413](https://github.com/StellarLend/stellarlend-contracts/issues/1413)
("`amm: flash_swap_a_for_b declared to return i128 but its body returns
Result<i128, AmmPoolError>`"). It is committed on the same branch so
maintainers can read it from the PR's file diff directly, without
depending on PR-thread content (which the agent's integration token
could not edit on the upstream repo — see "Sandbox / CI caveat"
below).

## Audit

Snapshot taken at **the base of this branch — `flash/swap` HEAD
`429fb5f6`** — i.e. **before** any of this PR's doc-only commits
(`b71cd854`, `a896e41e`, `4b8bb1c7`, and the consolidation
commits). All doc-only commits on this branch only extend the
existing crate-level rustdoc note; they introduce no `pub fn`, no
`use`, no storage key, no type, and no invariant, so the
non-line-number findings (zero declarations, single rustdoc-keyword
hit, five public entry points) hold at every SHA on this branch.
The line numbers below are anchors for the pre-PR snapshot; line
numbers shift as the rustdoc is extended, but `grep -c` counts and
the lack of any symbol declaration are stable.

                (sole hit is the rustdoc note itself; the
                 PR extends this note — zero fn / struct / type /
                 storage-key declarations anywhere in the crate,
                 at any SHA on this branch. The line above is
                 exactly the first 110 chars emitted by the
                 command on the previous line: the path prefix
                 is `stellar-lend/contracts/amm/src/lib.rs:28:`
                 (41 chars) and the remaining 69 chars are the
                 leading 69 characters of the rustdoc bullet
                 line at lib.rs:28. The actual rustdoc bullet
                 continues past column 110 with
                 `\`) and a dedicated \`AmmPoolError\` type are
                 **not implemented** in this crate; do not
                 reference them until they are introduced through
                 a tracked protocol change.`. Drop the
                 `| cut -c1-110` to see the full line. The
                 audit's verdict is on the *count* of hits —
                 exactly 1 — not on byte-exact column counts of
                 any single line.)

61:    pub fn remove_liquidity(env: Env, rem_a: i128, rem_b: i128) {
76:    pub fn swap_a_for_b(env: Env, amount_in: i128, fee_bps: i128) -> i128 {
108:   pub fn get_reserves(env: Env) -> (i128, i128) {
```

Conclusions (stable across every SHA on this branch):

- The symbol `flash_swap_a_for_b` is **not declared** anywhere in the
  AMM crate, so the report's claim of a return-type mismatch is *not
  applicable* on this branch.
- `AmmPoolError` is **not declared**, so no error type would need to
  be changed either.
- `repay_flash_swap` and `assert_no_active_flash_swap` are **not
  declared**, so no paired-API coupling on that side either.
- There are no flash-swap tests in the AMM crate, so no flash-swap
  test set whose pass/fail could be perturbed by this PR.

## Sandbox / CI caveat (transparency)

The original task explicitly said *"check that all tests pass"*. The
diff on this branch is doc-only — only `//!` lines added or
restructured in `stellar-lend/contracts/amm/src/lib.rs`, plus this
file. Any `cargo test -p stellarlend-amm` run on this branch returns
exactly the same result as on `main` (no behaviour, no imports, no
storage keys, no invariants changed).

The parent agent's execution sandbox does **not** have `cargo` /
`rustc` installed, so no `cargo test` was actually executed before
this PR was opened. Treat the **upstream CI** green-build signal on
this PR as the authoritative gate — see
[`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) for
what the gate runs. If the upstream workflow rejects the PR for any
reason that depends on a missing test run, ping the issue author;
the change itself contains no executable code paths that would
change a test outcome.

## Closing #1413

Issue #1413 is closed by the PR via `closes #1413` because the
report's premise ("a return-type mismatch on `flash_swap_a_for_b`")
is provably **not applicable** on this branch — the function does not
exist. If reviewers prefer that #1413 be closed as
**not applicable / won't fix** via a maintainer comment rather than
the auto-close keyword, that closure mode is compatible with this PR:
the rationale is recorded in the rustdoc, in this file, and in the
PR description regardless.

## Future protocol change

When the flash-swap protocol change lands, the following must be
introduced. Exact shapes are to be decided by the protocol-change PR,
not pinned by this docs-only PR — the bug report is **not** a design
doc.

1. `flash_swap_a_for_b(env, amount_out: i128, params: Bytes) ->
   Result<i128, AmmPoolError>` — a *candidate* signature recorded in
   the issue; the landed signature may differ (name and type may
   differ too).
2. `repay_flash_swap(...)` paired with `assert_no_active_flash_swap(...)`
   — names also subject to the protocol-change PR.
3. An error type (`AmmPoolError` per the issue, or whatever the team
   chooses to name it — to be decided by the protocol-change PR).
4. A **regression test** for the flash-swap surface, since none
   currently exercises the unimplemented API.
