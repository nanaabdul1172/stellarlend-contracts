# Risk Parameters

This document provides a consolidated view of all protocol risk parameters, including their purpose, constraints, and how they are configured.

> Verified against contract constants and admin setter constraints where applicable.


## Risk Parameters Table

| Parameter | Meaning | Default | Bounds | Setter Function | Rationale |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Debt Ceiling** | Maximum total protocol debt allowed across all users | **1 trillion** | > 0 | `set_debt_ceiling(ceiling)` | Limits protocol exposure and blast radius if price oracle fails |
| **Deposit Cap** | Maximum total protocol deposits allowed across all users | **1 trillion** | > 0 | `set_deposit_cap(cap)` | Limits protocol exposure to asset concentration risk |
| **Minimum Collateral Ratio** | Minimum ratio of collateral to total debt required for a borrow to succeed, in basis points | **15 000 bps (150 %)** | > 0 | `set_collateral_ratio(admin, ratio)` | Prevents under-collateralised borrowing and protects protocol solvency |
| Close Factor | Maximum portion of a borrower's debt that can be repaid in a single `liquidate` call, in basis points | **5 000 bps (50 %)** | `(0, 7 500]` | `set_close_factor_bps(close_factor_bps)` | Prevents full liquidation at once, reducing market shock and cascading failures |
| Liquidation Incentive | Bonus collateral, on top of the repaid debt, paid to the liquidator, in basis points | **1 000 bps (10 %)** | `[0, 5 000]` | `set_liquidation_incentive_bps(incentive_bps)` | Rewards liquidators for clearing bad debt while capping the bonus so it can't be misconfigured into an outsized collateral seizure |
| Liquidation Threshold | Collateral ratio below which a position becomes eligible for liquidation, in basis points | **8 000 bps (80 %)** | Fixed (`LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS` constant) | Not governable — recompile-only | Ensures positions remain sufficiently collateralized and protects lenders |
| Reserve Factor | Percentage of interest allocated to protocol reserves | Defined in code | 0% – 100% | Admin-controlled setter | Builds reserves for protocol stability and risk mitigation |
| Supply Cap | Maximum total supply allowed for a specific asset | Defined in code | ≥ 0 | Admin-controlled setter | Limits exposure to any single asset and reduces systemic risk |
| Borrow Cap | Maximum total borrow allowed for a specific asset | Defined in code | ≥ 0 | Admin-controlled setter | Prevents excessive leverage and liquidity stress |
| Minimum Borrow | Minimum borrowable amount | Defined in code | ≥ 0 | Admin-controlled setter | Avoids inefficient micro-loans and reduces spam |
| Rate Limits | Constraints on how quickly parameters or balances can change | Defined in code | Protocol-defined bounds | Admin-controlled setter | Prevents sudden parameter manipulation and extreme volatility |
| Minimum Collateral Ratio | Required collateral to debt ratio to prevent withdrawals or new borrows (10000 = 1.0) | 10000 | ≥ 10000 | Constant (code) | Prevents protocol insolvency by ensuring all debt is backed by collateral |

### Collateral-Ratio Formula

The borrow entrypoint (`stellar-lend/contracts/lending/src/lib.rs`) enforces:

```
collateral * 10_000 >= col_ratio * (existing_debt + borrow_amount)
```

where `col_ratio` is stored under the `"col_ratio"` instance-storage key (default **15 000 bps = 150 %**).

- `collateral` — value stored at `("col", user)` persistent key
- `existing_debt` — value stored at `("debt", user)` persistent key before the borrow
- `borrow_amount` — the requested borrow amount
- Arithmetic is performed with `checked_mul` / `checked_add`; overflow returns `BorrowError::Overflow` (code 2)
- Zero or negative collateral always returns `BorrowError::InsufficientCollateral` (code 1)

### Debt Ceiling & Deposit Cap Enforcement

**Debt Ceiling:**
- Enforced in the `borrow()` function before principal is updated
- Stored at `DataKey::DebtCeiling` in persistent storage
- Default: 1 trillion (configurable by admin via `set_debt_ceiling()`)
- When a borrow would cause `total_debt + borrow_amount > debt_ceiling`, the transaction fails with `LendingError::DebtCeilingExceeded`
- Total debt is tracked in `DataKey::TotalDebt` and incremented on borrow, decremented on repay

**Deposit Cap:**
- Enforced in the `deposit()` function before collateral is updated
- Stored at `DataKey::DepositCap` in persistent storage
- Default: 1 trillion (configurable by admin via `set_deposit_cap()`)
- When a deposit would cause `total_deposits + deposit_amount > deposit_cap`, the transaction fails with `LendingError::DepositCapExceeded`
- Total deposits are tracked in `DataKey::TotalDeposits` and incremented on deposit, decremented on withdraw

**Accounting Invariants:**
- `TotalDebt` = sum of all user principal balances (excluding accrued interest not yet settled)
- `TotalDeposits` = sum of all user collateral balances
- Both totals are updated atomically with per-user state changes
- Overflow/underflow is prevented via checked arithmetic; operations fail with `LendingError::Overflow`

### Governable Liquidation Parameters (Close Factor & Liquidation Incentive)

`LendingContract::liquidate` (`stellar-lend/contracts/lending/src/lib.rs`) sources its
close-factor cap and liquidation incentive from governed storage instead of from inline
`const` literals, so they can be retuned by the admin without a contract upgrade. The
liquidation threshold remains the fixed `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD_BPS` constant — it is not
governable.

| Parameter | Storage key | Default | Bounds | Setter | Getter |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Close factor | `DataKey::CloseFactorBps` (instance) | `DEFAULT_CLOSE_FACTOR_BPS` = 5 000 bps (50 %) | `(0, 7 500]` | `set_close_factor_bps(close_factor_bps)` | `get_close_factor_bps()` |
| Liquidation incentive | `DataKey::LiquidationIncentiveBps` (instance) | `DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS` = 1 000 bps (10 %) | `[0, MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS]` (`MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS` = 5 000 bps / 50 %) | `set_liquidation_incentive_bps(incentive_bps)` | `get_liquidation_incentive_bps()` |

**Behaviour:**
- Both setters call `assert_admin`; a non-admin caller's `liquidate`-affecting setter call
  fails with the host's auth error (`require_auth` rejection).
- `set_close_factor_bps` rejects `close_factor_bps <= 0` or `close_factor_bps > 7500` with
  `LendingError::InvalidCloseFactorBps` (code 7001). Storage is left unchanged on rejection.
- `set_liquidation_incentive_bps` rejects values outside `[0, MAX_LIQUIDATION_INCENTIVE_BPS]`
  with `LendingError::InvalidLiquidationIncentiveBps` (code 7002).
- Until an admin calls a setter, the corresponding getter — and `liquidate` itself —
  fall back to the default literal, so behaviour is unchanged for deployments that never
  configure an override (the same 50 % close factor / 10 % incentive as before this change).
- `liquidate`'s rounding policy is unaffected: `max_repay = debt × close_factor_bps ÷ 10000`
  and `seized = repay × (10000 + incentive_bps) ÷ 10000` both still floor via
  `math::checked_mul_div_floor`.

**Source:** `stellar-lend/contracts/lending/src/liquidation_params_test.rs` covers default
fallthrough, boundary acceptance, out-of-range rejection, unauthorised-caller rejection, and
that `liquidate` actually reads the overridden values end to end.

## Implementation Notes

- All parameters are enforced at the smart contract level.
- Validation is applied through:
  - Constant definitions
  - Admin setter functions
- Withdraw operations are also constrained by the same minimum collateral
  ratio invariant (`MIN_COLLATERAL_RATIO_BPS`): post-withdraw collateral must remain sufficient to back
  outstanding debt (including accrued interest).
- Any parameter updates must pass bounds checks before being applied.


## Verification

To verify correctness, refer to:

- Contract constants (e.g., `DEFAULT_DEBT_CEILING`, `DEFAULT_DEPOSIT_CAP` in `lib.rs`)
- Admin setter implementations in lending modules
- Test suite in `lib.rs` covering ceiling/cap enforcement and accounting invariants

Developers should ensure that:
- Documented bounds match enforced ranges
- Default values align with deployed configuration
- Aggregate totals remain consistent across all operations


## Design Considerations

These parameters are designed to balance:

- Protocol safety  
- Capital efficiency  
- Market stability  

Changes to these values should be governed carefully to avoid unintended economic consequences.

**Security Note:** The debt ceiling and deposit cap provide a critical safety mechanism. If a price oracle fails or is compromised, these limits prevent unbounded protocol exposure. The admin should monitor utilization and adjust caps as the protocol scales.

## Kink Utilization Rate Model

The protocol uses a **two-slope kink rate model** to compute dynamic borrow interest based on pool utilization. This replaces the static default APR (`DEFAULT_APR_BPS = 500` = 5%) when `set_rate_params` has been called by the admin.

### Formula

```
utilization = total_borrow / total_supply

if utilization <= kink_utilization:
    rate = base_rate + utilization * multiplier
else:
    rate = base_rate + kink_utilization * multiplier + (utilization - kink_utilization) * jump_multiplier

final_rate = clamp(rate, rate_floor, rate_ceiling)
```

All values are in basis points (1 bps = 0.01%).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default (bps) | Admin Setter |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| `base_rate_bps` | Minimum borrow rate at 0% utilization | 100 (1%) | `set_rate_params()` |
| `kink_utilization_bps` | Utilization threshold where slope increases | 8 000 (80%) | `set_rate_params()` |
| `multiplier_bps` | Slope before kink (per-basis-point of utilization) | 2 000 (20%) | `set_rate_params()` |
| `jump_multiplier_bps` | Slope after kink (per-basis-point of excess utilization) | 10 000 (100%) | `set_rate_params()` |
| `rate_floor_bps` | Hard floor on computed rate | 50 (0.5%) | `set_rate_params()` |
| `rate_ceiling_bps` | Hard ceiling on computed rate | 10 000 (100%) | `set_rate_params()` |

### Curve Shape

- **Below kink (utilization ≤ 80%)**: Rate = base_rate + utilization × multiplier. Linear, gentle slope (e.g., at 50% utilization: 100 + 5000×2000/10000 = 1100 bps = 11%).
- **At kink (utilization = 80%)**: Rate = 100 + 8000×2000/10000 = 1700 bps = 17%.
- **Above kink (utilization > 80%)**: The jump_multiplier kicks in, creating a steep slope to incentivize depositors and discourage additional borrowing near full utilization.
- **Guards**: The rate is always clamped to `[rate_floor_bps, rate_ceiling_bps]`, preventing negative rates and unbounded APRs.

### Monotonicity Invariant

The `compute_borrow_rate` function is **monotonic non-decreasing** in utilization: if `utilization_a ≤ utilization_b`, then `rate_a ≤ rate_b`. This invariant is verified with 256-case property-based tests in `rate_model.rs::monotonicity`.

### Configuration

The admin calls `set_rate_params(params)` to configure the model. Until called, the contract falls back to the static `DEFAULT_APR_BPS` constant (500 bps = 5%) for backward compatibility.
