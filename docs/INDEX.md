# Documentation Index

This document provides a central, canonical entry point for all project documentation.

> **Contributing docs**: All canonical documentation belongs under `docs/`.  
> Do not add markdown files to the repository root — they are not discoverable here
> and will be removed. If you need to attach notes to a PR or issue, use a GitHub
> comment or a `docs/` subdirectory. Scratch files (`*_SUMMARY.md`, `PR_*.md`,
> `*_output.txt`, etc.) are periodically pruned from root.

## Source of Truth

For accuracy and implementation details, always prefer:

- Structured documentation in `docs/`
- Contract source code in `stellar-lend/contracts/lending/src/`
- Component docs under `stellar-lend/contracts/lending/`

*Consolidation Rationale*: Historically, the repository root accumulated PR artifacts,
scratch files, and one-off summaries that obscured canonical documentation. All such
files have been removed or migrated under `docs/`. If you find a root-level `.md`
file that isn't `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, it is likely stale — open an issue
to have it migrated or removed.
