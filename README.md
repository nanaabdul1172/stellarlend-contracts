# StellarLend Smart Contracts

## Overview

StellarLend is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol built on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. The protocol enables users to deposit collateral, borrow assets, accrue interest, and participate in a secure, transparent, and risk-managed lending market. Designed for DeFi developers, protocol integrators, and users seeking a robust lending solution on Stellar, StellarLend provides comprehensive features including cross-asset support, flash loans, AMM integration, governance mechanisms, and advanced risk management tools.

The protocol is built with production-grade security in mind, featuring social recovery, multisig governance, upgrade mechanisms, and comprehensive monitoring and analytics. Whether you're building a DeFi application, integrating lending capabilities, or contributing to the protocol's development, StellarLend offers a complete, auditable, and extensible foundation for decentralized lending on Stellar.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust** (latest stable version) - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust) - [Cargo Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- **Soroban CLI** - [Install Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/installation)
- **Stellar CLI** (optional, for advanced operations) - [Stellar Developer Tools](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools)

#### Installing Rust Components

After installing Rust, add the required components:

```bash
# Add Rust formatting and linting tools
rustup component add rustfmt clippy

# Add WebAssembly target for Soroban contracts
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Installing Soroban CLI

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install stellar-cli

# Or using cargo
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd stellarlend-contracts
   ```

2. **Navigate to the contract directory**:
   ```bash
   cd stellar-lend/contracts/lending
   ```

3. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   # Check Rust version
   rustc --version
   
   # Check Cargo version
   cargo --version
   
   # Check Soroban CLI
   stellar --version
   ```

### Environment Setup

No environment variables are required for local development and testing. The contract uses Soroban's built-in test utilities for development.

For deployment to networks, you may need:
- Network RPC endpoint (for testnet/mainnet)
- Admin account keypair
- Oracle contract addresses (if using external oracles)

### Building

Build the contract using the Soroban CLI:

```bash
# From stellar-lend/contracts/lending/
stellar contract build

# Or using Cargo directly
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Or using the Makefile
make build
```

The compiled WASM file will be located at:
```
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellarlend_lending.wasm
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# From stellar-lend/contracts/lending/
cargo test

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_function_name

# Or using the Makefile
make test
```

### Running Local CI Checks

To reproduce CI checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# From project root
chmod +x local-ci.sh
./local-ci.sh
```

This script runs:
- Format checking (`cargo fmt`)
- Linting (`cargo clippy`)
- Contract building and optimization
- Unit tests
- Security audit (`cargo audit`)
- Documentation generation

### Network Deployment

#### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Build the contract
stellar contract build

# Deploy to testnet (requires testnet account)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellarlend_lending.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-testnet-keypair>

# Initialize the contract
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <contract-id> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <admin-keypair> \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <admin-address>
```

#### Deploy to Mainnet

```bash
# Build and optimize
stellar contract build
stellar contract optimize \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellarlend_lending.wasm

# Deploy (use optimized WASM)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellarlend_lending-optimized.wasm \
  --network mainnet \
  --source <your-mainnet-keypair>
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: Always audit and test thoroughly before deploying to mainnet. Use multisig for admin operations in production.

## Contract Modules

The canonical contract lives at `stellar-lend/contracts/lending/`. Its module layout:

### `lending` (`stellar-lend/contracts/lending/src/`) — the canonical contract

Core lending logic (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidation, pausing, oracle price
handling, cross-asset positions, etc.) lives directly in `lib.rs` as `#[contractimpl]`
functions on `LendingContract` — there are no separate `deposit.rs`/`borrow.rs`/`repay.rs`/
`withdraw.rs`/`liquidate.rs`/`oracle.rs`/`governance.rs`/`amm.rs`/`flash_loan.rs`/`analytics.rs`
files in this crate. The supporting modules that do exist are:

- **`debt.rs`**: Debt position accounting and interest accrual (global borrow-index model plus legacy elapsed-time accrual).
- **`cross_asset.rs`**: Multi-asset collateral/debt storage helpers and cross-asset health-factor computation.
- **`rate_model.rs`**: Kink-model interest rate curve, plus rate smoothing/hysteresis.
- **`rounding_strategy.rs`**: Configurable-rounding interest calculator used by `debt.rs`.
- **`math.rs`**: Shared checked-arithmetic helpers.
- **`events.rs`**: Versioned event structs/emitters for deposit/withdraw/borrow/repay/liquidate.
- **`upgrade.rs`**: Self-contained timelocked multisig upgrade governance (propose/approve/execute).

See the contract's own [README](stellar-lend/contracts/lending/README.md) for the full, accurate interface.
